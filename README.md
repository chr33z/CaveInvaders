CaveInvaders
============

A virtual reality game implemented for a VR cave setup in the context of a university semester course.

The game reinvented the classic Space Invaders and replaces it in a cave with a brittle ground that gets more dangerous with time. Space Invaders fly around the player who is situated in the center of the cave. He can shoot energy balls with a IR tracked controller and destroy the evil brute from outer space. The game is either won by destroying all creatures or lost when the ground below the player has fallen into the abyss. 

A fun game but unfortunatelly difficult to play at home!
